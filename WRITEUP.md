### Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.

*For **both** a VM or App Service solution for the CMS app:*
- *Analyze costs, scalability, availability, and workflow*
- *Choose the appropriate solution (VM or App Service) for deploying the app*
- *Justify your choice*
Costs: VM is higher than App Service
Scalability: App Service is easier to scale, VM require manual
Availability: App Service more availability, VM need to config with more than complex
Workflow: App service easier to deploy, VM require manual to deploy, config

So I choose App Service for deploying my app - it easier for a newbie like me
